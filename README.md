## Overview
This website is designed and created for Dubhacks 2020. With the way that the web has developed, people are constantly surrounded by media that fits their view of the world. On one hand, this is excellent for connecting with like-minded people, but on the other, we get stuck in a bubble that prevents us from understanding people who don't share our beliefs. Our goal was to create a website that provides information for one subject from a variety of sources to break this bubble. By providing the variety of sources, everyone can have access to how biased the media is. 

## Files
The other files are the initial starting points of our website. The title page has our explanation for our creation of this site along with the navigation bar that takes users to the topic they'd like to learn more about. The Supreme Court and COVID pages are just 2 examples of topics that users can select (and hopefully one day just search for) to learn more about. Each page will have consistent style provided by the shared CSS, but the pages will also share a similar layout to improve ease for users. Since our goal is for a variety of people to be accessing our site, maintaining the layour is essential.
