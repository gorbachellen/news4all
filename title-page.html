        <p>We believe that news matters. Therefore, we used this news media bias chart that sorts some of your favorite news outlets based on their biases:</p> <br>

        <p>Using this chart, we have separated news media companies into 3 categories: Left-Leaning, Center, and Right-Leaning.</p> <br>
