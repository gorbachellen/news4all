            <p>We believe that news and the way it's worded matters. Therefore, we used this news media bias chart that sorts some of your favorite news outlets based on their biases:</p> <br>
            <img src = "https://www.adfontesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Media-Bias-Chart-6.0_Low_Res_Licensed-1200x921.jpg" alt = "It didn't show up, oof"/> <br>
            <p>
                Using this chart, we have separated news media companies into 3 categories:
                Left-Leaning, Center, and Right-Leaning.
